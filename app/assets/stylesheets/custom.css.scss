

body {
  display: flex;
  min-height: 100vh;
  flex-direction: column;
}

main {
  flex: 1 0 auto;
}
You can do this using transform:scaleY() and set the transform-origin to bottom. I also put a margin-top:100px to see the effect better. Also you can use transition to make the scale smoother

You also need to scale back the text.

See here: jsfiddle

You need to scale the text back to it's original state in the same time that you scale the div. so if you scale the div 2 times. You need to scale back the text with 1/2 , same if you scale 3 times...scale back with 1/3

In this case you enlarge .content by 1.5 so you need to scale down the text inside by 1/1.5 = 0.66

Code:

.box {
  height: 170px;
  padding-bottom: 15px;
  width: 50%;
}

.content {
  background-color: #e3e4e6;
  height: 100%;
  text-align: center;
  margin-top: 300px;
  transition:0.3s;
}

.content:hover p {
  transform: scaleY(0.66)
}

.content:hover {
  transform: scaleY(1.5);
  transform-origin: bottom;
}
